SporkPGM
========

ParaPGM - RELOADED! 


How to set this thing up
------------------------
This plugin requires WorldEdit. You can download it [here](http://dev.bukkit.org/media/files/715/448/worldedit-5.5.7.zip "here")
Put SporkPGM into your plugins folder along with WorldEdit. Then, create a "maps" folder where you will put your maps. Make sure you have a map.xml file inside
or else it won't load. 

Thats about it!
