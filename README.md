SporkPGM 2.0.0
==============

## Using SNAPSHOT builds
These versions of SporkPGM are unstable and incomplete - any use of this build is done so at your own risk.
If you find an issue with a snapshot build, report the issue or post a pull request with a possible fix.

Any issues regarding the dependencies used should be noted inside an issue, if a custom dependency such as [Commons](https://github.com/ParaPenguin/Commons) is not the latest build, please post an issue in the Spork repository *NOT* the Commons repository, unless the code which was used in Spork has been pushed to the dependency's repository, in which case post an issue on the dependency's repository.

## Compiling SNAPSHOT builds
Compiling a snapshot build should be as simple as running `mvn clean install` in the root of the repository, if there are any issues, refer to "Using SNAPSHOT builds"

## Using public builds (from the releases page)
It is important to check what state a release is, sometimes the release you are using will be a pre-release or bleeding edge build, on these occasions it is important to report *all* issues with the plugin via the issues section on this GitHub repository.
If in the event that you have an issue with an old release, it is recommended that you update to the latest release. If you have an issue with a latest release, check with your peers to see if they are having the exact same issue, if nobody is having the same issue, report it on the issues section of this repository.
